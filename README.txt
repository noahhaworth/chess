This program simulates a pass and play version of chess. All basic rules, castling, promotion, en passant, and two move openings for pawns are all supported with the proper laws. The three move repetition and move caps when only the king is left is not supported. The game also does not check for checkmate automatically.

To play the game simply enter the coordinate location of the piece you would like to move, then the coordinate of the location you would like to move that piece to. Coordinates should be entered with the letter first, then the number (a1, h1, a8 & h8 are the corners of the board for example). To end your turn, enter the word 'checkmate' if you have won the game, or simply anything else if you have not won yet. This continues with two players until someone has won or you get bored and type in the word 'checkmate'.

In the future I would like to incorporate automatically checking for checkmate, and stalemate / drawing rules.
